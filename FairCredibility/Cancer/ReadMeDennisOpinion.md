In my opinion currently. You 3 best bets for treating cancers are the following:

1) [https://www.drlindai.com/](https://www.drlindai.com/) . The best  
2) [https://www.paleomedicina.com/en](https://www.paleomedicina.com/en) . The second best  
3) [https://riordanclinic.org/what-we-do/high-dose-iv-vitamin-c/](https://riordanclinic.org/what-we-do/high-dose-iv-vitamin-c/) This is  used as an adjunct therapy not the main, I suspect because of the legality.


<strong>What is wrong with the mainstream approach?</strong>


The approach appears to based on several misplaced beliefs:
- Takes the same approach to treating cancer as that of an infectious disease.
- heroics. (the philosophy on no pain no gain stretched to the level of a dogma). Heroics is often very psychologically satisfying than actually results to most people.
- Forgetting that Cancer is a systemic disease not a localized problem. (hence for example there is no focus on diet)
- An excessive obsession with high tech stuff and convoluted theories which may have a grain of truth in them. The mutation theory and all that. (The underlying philosophy here seems to be that if there is a big problem, the solution has to necessarily complicated)
