Important: John Henry Tildenon, was considered to be quack of sorts by his contemporaries, and I would think would be considered a quack even by today's standards, so if you are of the opinion that the medical profession currently does a generally good job, this post of mine can be ignored. This book was probably written in the 1920s.

According to John Henry Tildenon, most cases of appendicitis can be treated without surgery, If his treatment plan is followed. In which case surgery would be an exception, and not the norm.

Currently, as it was then, often with appendicitis generally speaking the overall opinion is that surgical intervention is the only solution. Astute people may have noticed that the medical profession can be overzealous when it comes to removing organs: ranging from gallbladder, tonsils, ovaries etc. depending on the fashion/fad off their generation.
When it comes to appendicitis though, it's a tough call, because often the person is in excruciating pain and immediate attention is warranted. Options offered generally are between 1) surgery and 2) near certain death, if surgery is not availed.

So here goes the treatment plan according to John Henry Tildenon :

- Do not give any food to the patient, until time that there is bowel movement. This could range anywhere from  about 2 weeks to 3 weeks.
- Water can be given to the patient, It should be warm but it should never be cold or ice cold.
- Do not aggressively palpitate the painful area. (aggressively palpitating,  in John's observation appears to be the norm, my observation is that things have not changed in a century)
- Keep the feet warm, ice may be applied to the painful area.
- Once there is bowel movement, start giving warm milk or bone broth. ( my personal recommendation would be to avoid milk for those who are sensitive to milk, the milk that we get has probably changed in a century)
- a fluid diet as mentioned above should be given for the first week, a light diet for the next 2/3 weeks, and then gradually a normal diet.

A scanned version of the book can be found at:  https://archive.org/details/appendicitisetio00tild or in this folder.
Relevant pages are from chapter IX , i.e page 117 onwards. Large portions of the book are dedicated to ( justifiably :) ) ranting against the medical community.
