In my opinion, currently your 3 best bets for treating cancers are the following:

1) [https://www.drlindai.com/](https://www.drlindai.com/) . The best. Also know as the Nicolos Gonzales/Kelly protocol. Involves taking proteolytic enzymes (dessicated pancreas). Advocates various diets ranging from near vegan to carnivore.
2) [https://www.paleomedicina.com/en](https://www.paleomedicina.com/en) . The second best. Involves a nearly all meat diet. Note: I'm fully aware of the Gerson therapy where they advocate a vegan diet. Interestingly Dr Gerson himself had raw calf liver juice along with the vegan diet in his original protocol which has been now discontinued. In my current opinion a vegan diet is never a good long term strategy for anyone. In some cases it can be even lethal to some individuals.
3) [https://riordanclinic.org/what-we-do/high-dose-iv-vitamin-c/](https://riordanclinic.org/what-we-do/high-dose-iv-vitamin-c/) . This is  used as an adjunct therapy not the main, I suspect because of the legality.


<strong>What is wrong with the mainstream approach?</strong>


The approach appears to based on several misplaced beliefs:
- Takes a similar approach to treating cancer as that of an infectious disease. In this case it is chemotherapy. ( Note: I'm aware that _all_ chronic diseases have an infectious componet to it)
- Heroics (the philosophy ofno pain, no gain stretched to the level of a dogma). Heroics is often very psychologically satisfying than actually results to most people. Heroics here include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.
- Forgetting that cancer is a systemic disease not a localized problem (hence, for example there is no little or no attention to diet).
- An excessive obsession with high tech stuff and convoluted theories which may have a grain of truth in them. This includes the gene mutation theory and all that. The underlying philosophy here seems to be that if there is a hard problem, the solution has to be necessarily high tech and/or convoluted.
- Earlier detection of a cancer because of better diagnostic methods now means that the survival rate (roughly defined as the person surviving 5 years after he/she has been diagnosed) is artificially extended, which is mis-attributed to the treatment than the earlier detection.

Note: some cancers do respond well to conventional treatments but they are the exceptions. As far as I know they are the lymphomas, ovarian and testicular cancers.

ToDo:
-Mention Gerson Therapy and realted topics like calf liver juice and their advocacy of veganism.
