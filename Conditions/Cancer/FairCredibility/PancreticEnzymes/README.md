<strong>Summary  </strong>  


The therapy using a combination of diet, enzymes(primarily desiccated pork pancreas) and supplements, coffee enemas, saunas etc. The content in this folder does not have all information, but will give the reader sufficient links and hints to dig up all the information on the internet.


<strong>How is this better than the  mainstream  approach:</strong> 

The outcomes are significantly better. For example people with pancreatic cancer appear to live for years using this approach rather than a few months using the mainstream approach.

<strong>Numbers :</strong>  


An educated guess:
80% of the patients have an extraordinary success vs say about 10% success of mainstream approach. success can be defined as a good functional quality of life.

ToDo:  To be investigated

<strong>Have you investigated the critiques of this treatment or drug, is the criticism well found? </strong>  


Critiques often target the coffee enemas and rely on the amusement it generates to dismiss the whole therapy as being quacky. ( Note: I actually check the online version of the Merck manual. Up until the early 70s coffee enemas were part of mainstream medicine - Dennis) They also cite the main stream trail that failed. Dr Nicholas J. Gonzalez  explains why the trial failed in this [book](https://www.amazon.ca/What-Went-Wrong-Clinical-Treatment/dp/0982196539?SubscriptionId=AKIAILSHYYTFIVPWUY6Q&tag=duc12-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0982196539) Apparently the trial was incorrectly designed and included patient who did not (or could not) comply with the protocol. [Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4712871/) is an analysis by Dr Linda Issacs. If the link does not work, a version can be found [here](30-32.pdf)
