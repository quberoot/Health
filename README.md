
What a typical listing of a  therapy/treatment should contain in plain English ( i.e not overly obscured by terminology and statistical jargon):

- A summary
- How many hours have you spent looking at this therapy/drug?
- What is wrong with the mainstream approach? Why is this therapy/treatment a better alternative than the mainstream approach. Why are the anecdotes/approaches of the mainstream wrong? (example, many vegans report feeling better when going off meat. What is actually happening is that they are going off many junk food that they may be eating, so it is not going off meat that is the source of better well being. The key here is people fail to take into account the various variables involved.)
- In what proportion of the population does it work and to what degree? Quantify it in simple numbers even if you do not have hard numbers. List the sources: 1) personal experimentation 2) anecdotes from reliable people 3)Studies. 4) An educated guess etc.  If you read a research paper quantify the numbers presented in the paper in  simple terms. 
- who are the practitioners. Please put link and contact information.
- State actual results  not just numbers from blood work and other seemingly objective measures. Example how does the person feel? Do they sleep better? Do they feel more/less hungry? Do they have more energy?  The reason being that numbers can be misleading. To give a good example, the mainstream considers a high LDL as something that needs to be corrected. Around 50% of people who do low carb diets have a high LDL but are overall doing great. This means that the assumption that  high LDL is a problem is incorrect in the first place.
- How long do the positive and/or side effects take, to show up?
- What are the long term effects, whay is the toxic dose if any?
- Have you investigated the critiques of this treatment or drug, is the critism well found?
- Have you investigated the history of this therapy/treatment?
- Have you considered placebo?
