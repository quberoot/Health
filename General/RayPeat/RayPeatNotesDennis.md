<p>Ray Peat deserves a special mention because in my opinion he has&nbsp; probably the most nauanced ( and consequently can be difficult to understand) views when it comes to health topics. While all his views have not been verified, I do find that on an average I do come around to accepting his views. It is also easy to sometimes misinterpret what he says. For example he sometime avoids saturated&nbsp; fat not because it's bad in itself but because they tend to accumulate toxins. He actually thinks that saturated fat is protective. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Think twice before you think that the guy is does not know what he is talking about. </span></p>
