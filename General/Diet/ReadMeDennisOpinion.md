Time spent on this subject by me is approximately 500 days (each day = 8 hrs) over a period of 20 years. Approximately 20 days in a year.

Here are key things to be considered when talking or proposiing a diet that you think some people will do well on:
--------------------------
- State percentage of people who will respond well to the 'diet' that you are talking about who _do not_ exercise but are fairly not sedentary. This figure need not be some official figure, your best guess is good enough. Tell us how you arrived at this best guess figure. Stating that people are different is not sufficient, you have to come up with some numbers.
- State percentage of people with chronic conditions like arthritis,migranes who respond well to this diet beyond 6 months.
- If some people do not respond to the diet that you propose, why do you think that may be happening diet? Are they not doing it correctly? Are they biologically different?
- What other diets have you self-experimented with? If you have not self experimented, why?
- Specify exact proportion of foods that constitute the diet that you are proposing. Mention  all foods, do not leave anything out including condiments.
- Are you (hypothetically) willing to place a bet (in good faith) , on the diet that you think will help with someone's health condition? Such a bet has the enormous advantage of a win-win situation. (TODO: explain whay it's win-win)


Of the people who respond well to the diet, what are the criteria have you used to decide that they are indeed doing well?
As subjective as it may sound (as opposed to concrete well defined figures like cholesterol or sugar levels)) mention the following:
- How do they feel? Is it any different than when they were not on the diet.
- Do they sleep better?
- Do they digest food better? Do they have better motions? What about GERD, bloating etc. ?
- Do they have more energy?
- Do they have more/less visceral fat?
- Have they gained/lost weight?
- Does their skin do better/worse?
- Do they drink more water?
- Do they feel more hot/cold?
- Do they have vivid dreams?
- Is their libido better/worse?

Things I would like the person to be aware of when discussing a diet topic:
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Addictive nature of certain foods, withdrawal symptoms. How would you distinguish craving for an addictive food versus craving for a necessary food?
- The general dogma/politics in science.
- That good quality anecdotes are often better that 'studies'. Studies in most cases are epidemiological in nature.
- Most studies are based on questionnaires.
- What is the evolutionary advantage for a carnivore over a herbivore, what are the disadvantages. What is the evolutionary advantages of an omnivore.
- The role of cooking. What foods are best cooked, what may be eaten raw?
- Are you aware of the Inuit paradox, French paradox and the Israeli paradox?
- How would you design an experiment to prove that a food is good/bad?
- Evolutionary biology. 
  - Have you heard of the expensive tissue hypothesis?
  - What do you know about domestication of plants for food?
  - Why do certain foods have toxins in them, eg certain fish, cassava, potato etc.
- Have you considered, what I call the allergy/sensitivity spectrum of foods. (Note: mainstream considers an allergy to be very different from a sensitivity, but here I have clubbed both together)
- Digestability of food which not coincidentally follows the allergy/sensitivity spectrum of foods.
- Common deficiencies caused by vegan foods: protein, Vitamin A, Vitamin B12, Vitamin D3, Vitamin K2, zinc, iron

My suggested allergy/sensitivity spectrum of foods, in the order of increasing sensitivity
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Red ruminant meat [least sensitivity, Notice, I have kept out poultry and pork]
- Eggs
- Fish
- Ripe sweet fruit
- Root vegetables(potato, cassava etc. in the cooked form)
- Shell fish, lobster etc.
- Vegetables (leaves, stem etc.)
- Nuts, seeds (includes rice, wheat, legumes etc.) [most sensitivity]
